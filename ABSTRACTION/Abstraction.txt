  Abstraction :
-----------------
  => It is the process of hiding implementation details from the user and showing only neccessary details to the user.
  => We can achieve abstraction in two ways.
         1) By using abstract class
         2) By using interface 

    Abstract method :
   -------------------
     => The method which is declared as abstract is known as abstract method. 
     => Abstract method always ends with a semicolon.
     => Abstract method does not have method body. 
     => If you want to give the implementation for the abstract method then we need to give in the next child class by using
        method Overridding concept.

    Abstract class :
  --------------------
     => The class which is declared as abstract is known as abstract class.
     => Inside the abstract class we can write both abstract method and normal method.
     => It is not mandatory to write atleast one abstract method inside abstract class.
     => Writting abstract method and normal method inside abstract class always optional.
     => If we are writting an abstract method inside a normal class then 100% the class should be declared as abstract claass
        otherwise we will be getting compile time error. [Inside a normal class we can't write an abstract method]
     => Inside a abstract class we can write normal methods, abstract methods, static methods, constructors and including main()
        also.
     => An abstract class can't be instantiated, means we can't create an object for the abstract class.
     => If we are inheriting an abstract class and in that abstract class if there is any abstract methods, then in the child
        class 100% we need to give the implementation for the all abstract methods present in the abstract class by using 
        method Overridding concept otherwise we will be getting compile time error.
     => If we don't want to give the implementation for that abstract methods present in the abstract class then make your child
        class also as abstract.
     => Variable, blocks and constructors can't be declared as abstract.

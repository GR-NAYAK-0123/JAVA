         Type Casting :
       ------------------
          => It is the process of converting one data type to another data type.
          => It is classified into two types.

     1) Impplicit TypeCasting :
           => This type casting converts a smaller data type into a larger data type.
           => It is automatically done by the java compiler.
           => There is no chance of loss of information.
           => It is also known as "widening"

     2) Explicit TypeCasting :
           => This type casting converts a larger data type into smaller data type.
           => It is not automatically done, it is the responsibility of the programmer to do that.
           => There may be a chance of loss of information.
           => It is also known as "Narrowing"

   Array :
 -----------
   => Array collects multiple element of similar datatype in a continous block of memory.
   => In java every array is an object.
   => At the time of array declaration we shouldn't specify the size of an array.
   => At the time of array instantiation 100% we need to specify the size otherwise we will be getting a compile time error.
   => We should not give negative size for an array.  [It will generate a NegativeArraySizeException]
   => We can give an array size as '0' but in that array we can pass any value.
   => We can use [int, byte, short, char] datatypes as length of an array.
   => Maximum array size is the maximum value of int datatype.


  Some different ways we can create an array :
-------------------------------------------------
  1) int arr[];   [This is declaration of an array]
     arr = new int[size];  [This is instantiation of an array]

  2) int arr[] = new int[size];  [Declaration and instantiation in a single line]

  3) int arr[] = {100, 200, 300};  

  4) int arr[] = new int[] {10, 20, 30};

 length :
----------
 => It is a final variable which is used to get the length of an array.
 => Ex : arr1.length;

 Drawbacks Of Array :
-----------------------
  => Array has fixed length.
  => Array only accepts homogeneous data.
  => Array doesn't have any method support.

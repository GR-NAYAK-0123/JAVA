   Wrapper Class :
--------------------
    => If we want to collect multiple element of different data type in that case we need to use collections like LinkedList,
       HashMap,HashSet,ArrayList, etc
    => In java collection class does not accept data type they are only accepts objects.
    => If we want to store different data type into collection classes then first we need to convert that primitive data type
       into their respective object classes.
    => Eight primitive data type have their respective eight wrapper classes.

               1) int     -   Integer
               2) byte    -   Byte 
               3) short   -   Short 
               4) long    -   Long 
               5) float   -   Float 
               6) double  -   Double 
               7) char    -   Character 
               8) boolean -   Boolean

    => All these wrapper classes are present in java.lang package 


    Autoboxing :
  ---------------
    => It means converting a primitive data type to it's respective wrapper classes.

    Auto un-boxing :
  -------------------
    => It means converting a wrapper class object to it's respective primitive data type.

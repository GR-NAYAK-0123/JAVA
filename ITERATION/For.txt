 For Loop :
------------
   for (Initialization : Test condition : Increment/Decrement){
       ------------------;
       ------------------;
   }
  => For loop consist of 3 statements.
       1) Initialization
       2) Test condition
       3) Increment / Decrement
  => Writting two semicolons in for-loop is mandatory otherwise we will be getting compile time error. 
  => Initialization statement executes only once in the fot-loop. 
  => increment and decrement statement will be executes only if the condition is true. 
  => Initialization and increment/decrement operator can be any valid statement. 
  => At the place of condition 100% we need to provide a condition, if we are not providing any condition then compiler by
     default consider the condition as true

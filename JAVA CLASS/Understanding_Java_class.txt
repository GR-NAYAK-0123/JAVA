   Understanding Java Class :
---------------------------------
   => A class is a blue print of an object.
   => We can create any number of object from a class.

   Q) Can we create an empty java file and compile and run it?
   => We can compile but we can't run it because the .classFile will not be generated as there is no className.
   Q) Can we create an empty java class and compile and run it?
   => We can compile and .classFile will be generated but we can't run it because there is no main() is present.
   Q) Is it Mandatory that java class Name and file Name should be same?
   => If the aceessModifier of the class is public then it is mandatory to give the file name same as the class Name but if the 
      aceessModifier of the class is default then no need to give the file name same as the class name.
   Q) What are the user defined methods/classes and predefined methods/classes?
        => A user defined method can start with both capital and small letter but the predefined method always start with small
           letter.
        => A user predefined class always start with Capital letter whereas the user defined class can start with both capital
           and small letter [But it is highly recommended to start a user defined class with capital letter].
   Q) How many methods we can write inside a java class?
   => We can write any number of method inside a java class.
   Q) When a java method will be executed?
   => A java method will be executed whenever we are calling them.
   Q) How to call a java method?
   => We can call a java method with the help of "It's respective class object".
   Q) How to create a class object?
   => We can create a class object with the help of "new" keyword and initialize them with the help of constructor.
                                                                           [Constructor name should be same as the class name]

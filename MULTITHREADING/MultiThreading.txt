   Multitasking :
 ------------------
   => It is a process of performing multiple task simultaneously by a single processor inorder to optimize the utilization of CPU
   => We can achieve Multitasking by two ways.
        1) By the help of multiprocessing.
        2) By the help of multithreading.
    
    Multi-processing :
  ---------------------
    => In this multiprocessing for every task there is separate process will be created which consumes a lot of memory.

    Multi-threading :
  ---------------------
   => It means running multiple part of program at the same time.
   => In this multithreading for every task there is a separate thread will be created and it saves a lot of memory space.

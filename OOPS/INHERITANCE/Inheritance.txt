    Inheritance :
  -----------------
     => Acquaring properties of one class into another class.
     => If we want to achieve inheritance we need to use either "extends" or "implements" keyword.
     => It is used for code reusability.

   
    KeyPoints :
  ----------------
     => We can hold parent class object with parent class reference and with that reference we can call only parent class methods.
     => We can hold child class object with parent class reference and with that reference we can call only parent class methods.
     => We can hold child class object with child class reference and with that reference we can call BOTH parent and child
        class methods.
     => We can't hold parent class object with child class reference, if we are trying to do that we will be getting an compile 
        time error.

     
        Constructor :
    --------------------
    => Constructor is a special type of method basically used to provide value for the instance variable.
    => It is also used to initialize the class object.

        Rule :
    --------------
    => Constructor name should be same as the class name.
    => Constructor doesn't have any return type.

        Key Points Of Java Constructor :
    ------------------------------------------
    => Constructor name should be same as the class name.
    => Constructor doesn't have any return type.
    => We need to initialize the class object with the available constructor present in our program.
    => In our program if you are not writting any constructor [Either parameterized or Non-parameterized] then java compiler 
       provide us with a default constructor.
    => Defaulf constructor is same as the Non-parameterized constructor.
    => Default constructor provided by java compiler and Non-parameterized constructor provided by the programmer.
    => The constructor which is provided by programmer [Either parameterized or Non-parameterized] we can use all the access 
       modifiers.
    => But the constructor which is provided by java compiler we can use only two access modifiers that is same as the access modifier
       of the class.
    => If we are making our constructor as private then we are restrict to create our class object in any other classes.
    => You can write return statement inside a constructor also but without returning anything.
    => Constructor Overloading is possible but overridding is not.

Q) How to call a constructor which is present in our program ?
=> We can call them simultaneously whenever we are creating our class object.


    Difference between constructor and a method :
  ---------------------------------------------------

      Constructor :
            => Constructor name should be same as the class name.
            => Constructor doesn't have any return type.
            => It is also used to initialize the class object.
            => In our program if you are not writting any constructor then java compiler provide us with a default constructor.

      Mathod :
            => You can give any name for the method but it should be following the naming convention of an identifier.
            => Writting return type is mandatory in method.
            => It is used to exposed the behaviour of the object.
            => In our program if we are not writting any method then java compiler doesn't provide us with any methods.

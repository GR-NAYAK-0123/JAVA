  Jump Statement :
--------------------
   => When compiler came accross jump statement then it will immediately goes to another part of the program. 
   => Java provides three jump statements
          1) break
          2) continue
          3) return
   => In addition java supports exception handling that can also alter the control flow of program
   => break - Compiler came out from the current loop
   => continue - Skip to the next iteration
   => We can use break statement only inside a "switch" and "loop"
   => We can use continue statement onlly inside a "loop"

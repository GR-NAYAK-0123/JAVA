# Difference between Collection and Arrays

    Arrays :
  ------------
  => It has fixed length. 
  => It can hold only homogeneous data.
  => It doesn't have any method support. 
  => It can hold both object and primitive data types.
  => Memory wise - It is recommended
     Performance wise - Not recommended

   Collections :
 ------------------
  => It is growable in nature.
  => It can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous data. 
  => It has a lot of method support. 
  => It can only accept objects.
  => Memory wise - Not recommended
     Performance wise - Recommended 


                                              Collection Framework :
                                            --------------------------
                          Collection (i)                                                                   Map (i)
                        ------------------                                                               -----------
                                                                                                        => HashMap
      List (i)                  Set (i)                    Queue (i)                                    => LinkedHashMap
    -----------               ----------                 -------------                                  => TreeMap 
 => ArrayList                => HashSet                 => LinkedList                                   => Hashtable
 => LinkedList               => LinkedHashSet           => PriorityQueue                                
 => Vector                   => TreeSet                                                                   (Classes)
                                                           (Classes)                                      
   (Classes)                   (Classes)


   List :
 ---------
 => In list elements will be stored just like an array but list allows duplicate data. 

   Set : 
 ---------
 => In set elements will be stored like an array but it doesn't allows duplicate data. 

   Queue :
 ----------
 => In queue elements will be stored in the FIFO order [First in First out]. 

   Map :
 --------
 => In map data will be stored in the form of key-value pairs

 Q) How to retrieve the data from the collection Classes ?
 => We can retrieve the data from the collection classes in below mentioned ways :

a) By using for-loop
b) By using for-each loop
c) Iterator Interface [By using this Interface we can retrieve the data ONLY in forward direction]
d) ListIterator Interface [By using this interface we can retrieve the data in BOTH direction]
e) Enumeration Interface [It is used to retrieve the data from legacy classes]


   Collection Object :
 -----------------------
 => A collection object can store group of other object. 
 => A collection object has a class called collection class.
 => All the collection class are present java.util package
 => A group of collection classes is called Collection Framework
 => All the collection classes in java.util package are implementation classes for different interface
                                                                                      [like : list, set, Queue, map]
 => In general collection framework consist of 3 parts
          a) Algorithm (Rules)
          b) Interfaces (abstract datatype)
          c) Implementations (concrete version of these Interfaces)

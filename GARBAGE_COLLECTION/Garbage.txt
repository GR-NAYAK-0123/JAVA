   Garbage Collection :
 ------------------------
=> It is a process of reaquaring the heap memory by destroying the unused and unreferenced objects from the heap area.
=> Garbage collector is going to use MARK and SWEEP algorithm for destroying the objects.
=> It will be working in the background of of every java program [It is a daemon thread].
=> Programmers no need to call garbage collector manually but if we want to call it manually then we can do that by using System
   class or Runtime class. 
=> It is not a process of collecting and discarding dead objects.It is more like making the "live" objects and everything else
   designated as garbage.
=> During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are deleted by garbage collector implicitly thus making space
   for new objects.

   Q) When garbage collector will be working on your program?
   => A garbage collector will be working on our program if there is an object is eligible for destruction.

   Q) When an object is eligible for destruction?
   => An object is eligible for destruction in one of the three below mentioned ways
         1) By Re-assigning the reference variable.
         2) By Nullifying the reference varibale.
         3) All objects created inside a method.

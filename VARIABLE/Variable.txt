      Variables :
    ---------------
    => Variable provides an identity to a memory location.
    => In java there are three types of variables are there.

    1) Instance Variable :
           => The variable which is declared inside a class, outside a method,block and constructor is known as instance variable
           => We can access instance variable in two ways. by using class object and identifier name.
           => If we are not initialize the instance variable then JVM will assign them with their default values.
           => If the instance varibale and local variable having same name then first priority will given to the local variable
    2) Static Variable :
           => The variable which is declared inside a class, outside a method,block and constructor with the help of "static"
              keyword is known as static variable.
           => We can access the static varibale in 3 ways i.e byusing identifier name, class boject and class name.
           => If we are not initialize the static variable then JVM will assign them with their default values.
           => Static variable couldn't be a locaal variable.
           => If the static varibale and local variable having same name then first priority will given to the local variable.
           => It is also known as class variable.
    3) Local Variable :
           => The variable which declared inside a method, bloack and constructor is known as local variable.
           => The scope of the local variable is only within that method. you can't access them outside.
           => We can access this varibale only by the identifier name.
           => If we are not initialize this varibale JVM will not assign them. It is the responsibility of the programmer to
              do that.
           => If we are decalre this varibale and then we are not using then in our program then our program can run normally
              but if we are trying to use this varibale without initializing then we will be geeting a compile time error.


    Objects :
  -------------
   => Object is created from a class.
   => We can create any number of object from a class.
   => We can create a object with the help of "new" keyword and initialize them with the help of constructor.
                                                                             [Constructor name should be same as the class name]

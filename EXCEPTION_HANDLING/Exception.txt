   Error :
  ---------
  => If your program is having an error then it will be terminated, We can not save our program.

    a) Compile time error : 
             => These error occurs due to the bad syntax in the program.
    
    b) Run time error :
             => These error occurs due to the inefficiency of the machine.

    c) Logical error :
             => These error occurs due to the bad logic by the programmer. 
    

   Exception :
 --------------
  => If your program is having an exception then it will be terminated but we can handle it by applying some exception handling
     technique.

    a) Checked Exception :
       => These exception is detected by the java compiler at the compilation time are known as checked exception.

    b) Unchecked Exception :
       => These exception is detected by the JVM at the run time are known as Unchecked exception.

  => Every exception always occurs at the run time but some of the exception occurs at Compile time and some are occurs at run 
     time.
  => An exception always occurs inside a method or inside a block.


  Q) How to Handle an exception ?
  => We can handle an exception by using try-catch-finally blocks.
  
       try{
            Inside the try block we need to write the suspicious code
       }
       catch(Exception e){
            Inside the catch block we need to catch the exception which is occured in the try block.
       }
       finally{
            Irrespective of an exception [Whether an exception occured or not] finally block always gets executed.
       }

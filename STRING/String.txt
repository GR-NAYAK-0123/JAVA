  String :
------------
  => String collects group of characters.
  => Every string data should be present inside a " ";
  => Whenever we are creating a string by using string class is immutable.
  => To know the length of the string we would use "length()".[It is a final method]

  Different ways to create a string :
--------------------------------------
   1) String s1 = "Raja Nayak";

   2) String s2 = new String("Raja Nayak");

   3) char arr[] = {'R', 'A', 'J', 'A'};
      String s3 = new String(arr);

   4) String s4 = new String (arr, 1, 2);
                  [Here 1 is starting index and 2 is the number of character from the index]

                

   Immutable :
 --------------
  => If we are creating a string by using string class then we can't change/modify it's content.If we are try to modify then 
     entirely a new object will be created.The changes can't affect the old object.

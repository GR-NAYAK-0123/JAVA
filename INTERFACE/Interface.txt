  Interface :
--------------
 => Interface is not a class, It is just blue print of a class.
 => Inside a interface by default every method is public abstract.
 => Inside a interface by default every variable is public static final.
 => From java 1.8v onwards we can write default methods inside an interface.
 => From java 1.8v onwards we can write static method and main() also inside an interface.
 => From java 1.9v onwards we can write private method inside an interface.
 => We can't write constructor inside an interface.
 => Just like abstract class we can't instantiate interface means we can not create an object for the interface.
 => If we want to inherit an interface into a class we need to use keyword "implements".
 => If we want to inherit an interface into a class and in the interface is having abstract method then in the child class
    100% we need to provide the implementation for the abstract method which is present in the interface otherwise we will be
    getting compile time error.
 => If we don't want to provide the implementation for the abstract method in the child class then we have to declare our child
    class as abstract.
